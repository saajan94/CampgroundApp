CampGuide is an application that uses Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to allow users to view and create various campsites. Passport is used for full authentication.

### How It Works
* Initially, the user can simply view the available campgrounds.
* Once a user account is created, comments can be added to existing campgrounds and new campgrounds can be created.
* Users are only able to manipulate/edit the items that they themselves create (comments, campgrounds, etc.).

### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* REST
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* HTML
* CSS
* EJS
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Passport
